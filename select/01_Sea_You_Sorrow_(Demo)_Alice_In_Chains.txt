Mind of destructive tastes
I choose, to stroll amongst the waste
It was your heart, lost in the dark
Call off the chase
Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time, I think of you
Oh yes I do
Such a crime
You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace
I'll never know
How far to go
To reach that place
You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
I Aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
